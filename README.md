## Projects Overview

### 1. Beginner Project — Image Tagging with TensorFlow  
- Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.  
- Collected and preprocessed image data.  
- Trained and evaluated the model using TensorFlow/Keras.  
- Visualized tagged images and model performance.

### 2. Intermediate Project — Bank Loan Approval Prediction  
- Loaded and analyzed a real-world bank loan dataset.  
- Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.  
- Applied classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest.  
- Evaluated model performance and visualized results using confusion matrices and plots.

### 3. Advanced Project — Sentiment Analysis with Transformers  
- Implemented a sentiment analysis model using the DistilBERT transformer from HuggingFace.  
- Processed multiple text inputs to extract sentiment polarity and confidence scores.  
- Visualized sentiment results and analyzed model behavior on diverse inputs.
